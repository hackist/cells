*** audio 
***** HALT combine audio track to video file
      - ffmpeg has serious lost frames problem, it could combine sound,
        but video quality is damaged
      - seems the problem due to not use x264 properly, Sorenson
        squeeze also has such problem
      - should be fixed after apply encode code from HandBrake
***** DONE split audio track out of video
      #!/bin/bash
      ffmpeg -i $1 -vn -acodec copy $1.`afinfo /tmp/sound |head -2|tail -1|cut -d ':' -f 2|sed -e 's/ //g;s+f$++g;s+WAVE+wav+g;s+MPG3+mp3+g;s+ac-3+ac3+g;s+AIFF+aif+g;s+3gpp+3gp+g'`
      - only extract audio file out is very fast, but convert format
        will be very slow, need aac -> wav -> mp3, is there any fast
        mp3 encoder?
      - only mp3 can be stream from web
        afconvert -v -f AIFF $1 --data BEI16@44100 $1.aif && lame
        $1.aif $1.mp3
***** DONE make lion tts output audio file
      #!/bin/sh
      say -o /tmp/h.aif -f $1 && afconvert -v -f m4af -d aac -b 64000 /tmp/h.aif $1.m4a  && afinfo $1.m4a
      1s sound, 20ms generate and compress time, 8k bandwidth
***** TODO tts service [1/7]
      - [X] basic idea
        (shell-command "qlmanage -p 2>/dev/null ./doc/bonjour.ting-ting.emlx")
      - [ ] http service first
            use Safari test it
      - [ ] compare install Node.js and uki gems
      - [ ] daemon it
      - [ ] package it
            - check OS
            - voice dependency
      - [ ] embedded VPN connection?
      - [ ] why not make it available on Mac App store?
*** image
***** DONE convert video to image stream
        #!/bin/bash
        mkdir thumb-$1 
        ffmpeg -i $1 -r 1 -s qqvga -f image2 thumb-$1/thumb-$1-%04d.png
        for f in thumb-$1/*.png; do
          convert -quality 80 $f thumb-$1/`basename -s .png $f`.jpg && rm $f
        done
      - take look at handbrake
        it build own encoder? 
        - clone github keep failed
          svn mirror?
        - just download the tarball
      - image sample quality
      - it is possible to embedded images into audio stream, it seems
        pretty cool bandwidth saving method
        http://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/HTTP_Live_Streaming_Metadata_Spec/2/2.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010435-CH2-DontLinkElementID_2
***** DONE empty image stream
      just draw some rectangle on client
      for audio only case
***** TODO merge image sequence into audio track [0/4]
      - [ ] it is last fall back when bandwidth in not enought
      - [ ] it seems better than audio book
      - [ ] it can be done with http stream server
      - [ ] how to merge this with slide show video making
            - is it possible to wrap quartz composer into mpeg-2
              transport stream packet?
            - the experience will be seamless?

            - tweak profile for screen capture
            - collect high quality movie's profile
              - like earthtouch or Apple trailers

            - export sample profile from popular transcoder
      - [ ] x264
            - encoder in Handbrake
              I think it's result seems much better than MC
            - learn it's algorithm
            - there is H.264 CUDA
            - it can be used in ffmpeg
      - [X] encoder in Final Cut
            - compressor
              - AIC -> ResPro
              - they use Main Concept before

            - GPGPU of AMD
      - [X] commercial encoder
            - Main Concept
              it support CUDA, but my card only has 253M memory, that
              need at least 512M
            - Squeeze
              - how to remove 3.6M video's water mark ?
                do not need that
              - how could encoder know video should choose static or
                motion profile?
                indeed there is no such significant difference there
