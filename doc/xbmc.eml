XBMC, XBox Media Center, other consoles also has similar projects, PS3  
media server, GeeXBox (it is not for XBox, but for Wii), all of such  
three typical projects indeed all come from game consoles, now, it  
coming to AppleTV, AwkwardTV is such a project, these project's  
initial protocol are all UPnP.

The purpose here is just playing movie stored on other place,  
streaming via home network and show it on TV, why they prefer consoles  
and Apple TV ? It looks more clean and neat than HTPC, not making  
noise, and they already have one, they have payed for such devices.

I guess your NAS has already been UPnP capable. UPnP is a bit like  
Bonjour, the client can automatically find available service.

So, if grab Youtube videos and transcode (maybe do not needed) them  
and saved on NAS (or any cloud storage), Apple TV should be able to  
play files in iTunes libraries if home sharing opened, create new user  
and configure iTunes point to such network folder, that's done, you  
can watch YouTube on TV via Front Row on Apple TV!

I don't believe the real problem here is how to play, Apple's Front  
Row is nice and we can do encoding remotely, people shouldn't waste  
huge time on that, the real problem is how could you select the  
content, deliver your favorite stuff, satisfy your taste, meet your  
purpose, that is the real hard problem we should invest our time to  
solve.

So We shouldn't hack another ugly UI, yet another media server on  
Apple TV, or plug-in or add-ons on those hacked platforms. I feel most  
people just can not figure out how to setup these ssh and debian  
packages, it's enough hard for them. We should provide valuable  
service, instead of jailbreak some platform even we disagree with  
them, for if we keep politely obey their rule, there will be no  
struggle abstract our energy to serve users on their platform, if we  
are unfortunately drop into such jailbreak trap, things will become  
ironical seems we just want to show we can. User do not want to watch  
such show, they want to watch something else, interesting, useful.
